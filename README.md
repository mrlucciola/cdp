7. In another terminal, navigate to the cdp-contracts repo `cd cdp-contracts`

8. Checkout the development branch: `git checkout mainnet_dev`

9. Build and deploy programs (smart contracts): `anchor build && anchor deploy`

This transaction may fail, saying that there is not enough SOL in your wallet.

If so, copy the address and airdrop to account, and deploy again: `solana airdrop 100000 _your_address_ && anchor deploy`

This will output the Program IDs/addresss for the both `stable-pool` and `stable-pool-faucet` programs.

10. Copy these addresses into Anchor.toml where it says `stable_pool = _ADDRESS_` and `stable_pool_faucet = _ADDRESS_`  respectively.

Additionally, copy those addresses into their respective lib.rs files where it says `declare_id!("_ADDRESS_")`

11. Rebuild and deploy programs/smart contracts again: `anchor build && anchor deploy`

12. Run tests: `anchor test`
